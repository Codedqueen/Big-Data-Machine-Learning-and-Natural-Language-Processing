    "\n",
    "You are given data from an audio book app. Logically,it relates to the audio version of books only. each customer on the data base has made a purchase atleast once.\n",
    "That is the condition to be included. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the audio book company. The main idea is that the company should extend its advertising budget targeting individuals who are unlikely to come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we focus our efforts on customers likely to convert again, we can obtain an improved sales and profitability figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our model will take several matics and will try to predict human behaviour. a side effect of the model is that the model which of the most important metrics for a customer to come back (conversion). \n",
    "Having the data and the technology to identify prospective customers creates alot of values and growth opportunities.It is one of the better application of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our data. the csv file is included in the lecture resources. when you download it the column headers will not be included as we want no test of the data when trianing the model.\n",
    "Each row represents a person. lwt's go through the model and see why each one of them could be abused. \n",
    "First, we have customer id, id is like a name. Whether the id is 1, 2, 3 , or john1 ,john2,john3, it makes no difference. As no information is contained in the id we will skip it in our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next,we have  book_length, the overall book_length is the sum of the length of all purchases, we also have the average book length which is basically the sum divided by the number of purchases. So if someone have bougth single audio book ,the average length and the overall length for this person will be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to include the number of purchases as it is contained in the two variables we just described.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then have the overall price paid and he average price paid. These variables were constructed in the same way as those of book length.  The price is in dollars , althogth it makes no difference to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price variable is almost always a good predictor of the earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next variable is review. Review is a boolean. It hows if  acustomer left a review. This is a matrix that shows enagement on the platform.\n",
    "Our assumption is that people who leave reviews are more likely to come back again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have  reviews_out_of_10, This is a different variable.It measures the reviews of a customer on a scale of 1 to 10( Reviews 10/10). Pay attention here as we will show you the first pre-processing trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, we will only have a value for people that left a review.By examing the table , we quickly see that that most people dont leave review as in most market places. This is bad for our dataset and bad in general. We have decided to leave the reviews posted in the platform and substitute all missing values with the average review. the average is 8.91 .\n",
    "\n",
    "for our machine learning algorithm, 8.91 = status quo, a review bigger than 8.91 will indicate above average feelings while a review lesser than 8.91 will indicate below average feelings.\n",
    "We use the word feelings because review is another variable that is an average. A customr may have bougth 2 or 3 books from the platform, the average reviews she left indicates her feelings towards the content on the median more better. The median as a whole.\n",
    "An average of 2 out of 10 indicates a person did not have a pleasant experiance on the audio books especially when the average is 8.91. It is logical, that such a customer is not likely to buy again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have toal minutes listenened. This is a measure of engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have completion, this is the total minutes listened divided by the total length of book a person have purchased.\n",
    "Assuming people dont eally listen to books . both variables are self explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next variable is support requests, it is numerical and shows the total number of support requests a person have opened. Support is anything from forgoten password to insistance on using the platform. Once more, this is a measure of enagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may turn out that the more support a person is needed the more he/she gets fed up with the platform and abandons it or he/she likes it so much that by using it he stumbles on different issues unlike someone who never opens the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally,we have a variable measuring the difference between the last time a person interacted with the platform and th first purcahse day. This is anothe measure of engagement. The bigger the difference the better. If a person enagaes regularly with the platform. His difference will be bigger, thus the customer is likely to convert again. If the value of this variable is zero,It shows customer has never accessed what he has bought or perhaps , he did it on the first day only and it is unlikely here she will convert again.\n",
    "These are our inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always necessary to ask how the data was gathered. This piece of information is valuable for any analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The day it was gathered from the audio book app as we said. It represents two years work of engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are doing supervised learning. So we need Targets. The targets will be a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 if a person converted and 0 if he /she didnt.\n",
    "What does it mean to convert?\n",
    "We have taken an extra 6 months of data after 2 years to check if a user converted. So we took 2 years and 6 months. We have 2 years and 6 months of data .\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 2 years are contained in the datset (inputs) we already explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 6 monts will show us if a person converted , in other words if he or she bought another book and if it happened , we can count that as conversion, the target will be 1 , otherwise 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we created the Targets column. 6 months sounds reasonable for us. If one buys no new books , it means they might have gone to outr competitor or dont ike the audio book way of digesting information"
